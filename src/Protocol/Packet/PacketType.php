/**
 * MQTT control packet types for MQTT 3.1.1 and 5.0 (values 1..14).
 *
 * Each packet type represents a specific message in the MQTT protocol:
 * - CONNECT: Client request to connect to broker
 * - CONNACK: Broker acknowledgment of connection
 * - PUBLISH: Publish message to a topic
 * - PUBACK: QoS 1 publish acknowledgment
 * - PUBREC: QoS 2 publish received (part 1 of two-phase acknowledgment)
 * - PUBREL: QoS 2 publish release (part 2 of two-phase acknowledgment)
 * - PUBCOMP: QoS 2 publish complete (final acknowledgment)
 * - SUBSCRIBE: Client subscription request
 * - SUBACK: Broker subscription acknowledgment
 * - UNSUBSCRIBE: Client unsubscribe request
 * - UNSUBACK: Broker unsubscribe acknowledgment
 * - PINGREQ: Client ping request (keepalive)
 * - PINGRESP: Broker ping response
 * - DISCONNECT: Client or broker disconnect notification
 *
 * The packet type value is encoded in the upper 4 bits of the fixed header's first byte.
